# First-GUI
 My first Java program utilizing a GUI!
## What is it?
- A simple clicking game
- Click the button to increment, and click the subtract button to decrement
- Gamble your clicks! (The house likes to win)
- You cannot gamble when clicks are -1, 0, 1 as that makes no sense

## What I learned
- Java Swing Class!
- Frame vs Panel (took a while)
- Panel labels
- Swing buttons:
  + making them
  + basic placements
  + taking input
  + enable / disable
- a lot more!
